# wp-vanilla-carousel

A wordpress content slider built with pure css, php, and vanilla javascript.

The goal was to have a content slider plugin that won't break on core wordpress/jquery upgrades.

Since it does not rely on JQuery, Owl-Carousel, Bootstrap, or any external dependencies, it requires little maintenaince ( in theory ;) ).
